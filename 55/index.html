        Many software packages and open-source projects now support WoT, including tools for Thing Description
        validation and construction as well as support for Thing runtimes and Thing Description directories supporting
        discovery.

        Market adoption of the Web of Things is gaining momentum, with notable products such as SayWoT! and Desigo CC
        from Siemens and the Building Communication System from Takenaka. Interesting products from startups are also
        appearing like MONAS and Agor√† from VAIMEE for creating digital twins of cast-resin transformers, and in the
        agricultural domain for crops and terrains; and Krellian Cloud, which provides real-time data analytics for
        smart buildings. Additionally, the Web of Things has either been adopted or is under consideration for adoption
        by several standards organizations, including ECHONET, Conexxus, the OPC Foundation (OPC UA Web-of-Things
        Connectivity), IPA Digital Architecture Design Center, and Industrial Digital Twin Association (Asset Interfaces
        Description).

        The growing WoT user community is supported by multiple WoT Community Groups, which hold regular meetings to
        share information on WoT and its applications in both English and Japanese.
